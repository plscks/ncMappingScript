# ncMappingScript
Testing out the idea of pulling map data from Nexus Clash with a userscript and loading it into a google sheets document.
Certainly there will be elements of this taken from [LibC](https://github.com/AnneTrue/libConglomerate) as it does a wonderful job of data collectionn already.
This is a work in progress and should be a rather fun exercise, see you on the other side.
